title: Search Relevance in a Web 2.0 World

There's been a ton of chatter in the blogosphere about the rise of spam in the land of Google. I've definitely noticed this, but only in a limited sense.

Background
==========

First off, some content I've found illuminating on this topic:

* [Marco Arment (of Instapaper)][http://www.marco.org/2617546197] - Search can be broken down into 4 major query types. Argues (convincingly) that content factories (eg expertsexchange, about, ehow etc.) have managed to drown out everything useful for a wide range of queries.
* [Jeff Atwood (of Stack Overflow)][http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html] - Google is overrun by content duplication. Uses the example of content on Stack Overflow to argue that content mills have figured out how to beat Google's protections, and that google isn't responding (Jeff needed [Matt Cutts][http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/] - Google's semi-official SEO referee - to intervene).
* [Vivek Wadhwa (a researcher at UC Berkeley / Harvard / Duke)][http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/01/why-we-desperately-need-a-new-and-better-google-2/] - Google spammers make their money from Google's advertising products. Most of the article reads like an ad for blekko.com, but it makes the important point that Google is providing the monetization strategy for spamming Google.

Here are some queries I've found bad, along with a short explanation comparing what I expected versus what I got:
